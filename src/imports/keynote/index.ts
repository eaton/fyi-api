// First pass: Automate the process of exporting Keynote presentations to structured JSON
// using JSX automation scripts to control PDF and image exporting. This should also generate
// the skeleton for slide-by-slide transcript text as well.

// Second pass: Use JSX to extract more detailed Keynote file metadata, up to and including
// Generation of alt text for slides. We'll see how good it is at that.
