# The API

So, the whole reason I'm writing a migration project is to build a consolidated
repository for all the stuff I've ever made, without relying on a third party
service's 'save everything here!' API.

I want to generate multiple outputs from this data â€” twitter.eaton.fyi for what
amounts to a mirror of my old Twitter account, timeline.eaton.fyi for a visual
view of statistics about all the stuff I've made, reading.eaton.fyi for a stream
of articles, books, and so on aggregated from social shares and bookmarks, a
traditional blog.eaton.fyi site, and so on.

I want to be able to *reference* things from the entire repository and have the
links *resolve* to the correct destination. I want to be able to perform bulk
operations on the whole kit and kaboodle (entity extraction on the raw text of
everything, build a vector database, whatever).

I want to be able to set up ongoing feeds *into* this repository when it makes
sense; regular posts on Bluesky shouldn't require re-running a complex migration
process.

I also want garden.eaton.fyi to hold incomplete works: scratchpads for essays,
talks, and posts that are still evolving but haven't found a permanent home.
When those things DO find a final place to live, I want the history to stay but
the canonical link to point at the new "official" location for the completed
work.

I want to have a giant archive of this stuff, because patterns and connections
fascinate me. Even if no one else finds value in it, I want to play with these
because that's personally rewarding.

I have a lot of wants, and wishes, and dreams. We'll see how it pans out.
